# ALMA Configurator

## What is ALMA?

ALMA is a flutter app that simply helps with configuring and patching the original F.E.A.R. game and it's expansions with fixes from (PCGamingWiki)[https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/F.E.A.R.] page. Its not complex at all, however it does improve stability and performance drastically.

## Why create ALMA?

The goal of ALMA is just to make playing F.E.A.R simple, without needing to troubleshoot. Its not only designed to make it easier to recommend F.E.A.R to friends and family, but also for myself. While I can debug and manually tweak each game to work flawlessly, I sometimes just want to reinstall F.E.A.R and start playing.

## Future Plans for ALMA

1. Add key rebinding to ALMA, so the same key binds are shared between all three games.
2. Have a graphics section in settings.
3. Even more tweaks.
